# Learning Linear Regression in Python but Not Using sklearn

### Warning: Linear Algebra and Calculus are highly-needed for learning linear regression.

* In this repository, I'll try my best to avoid using sklearn in Python since my goal is to understand how the mathematics work in linear regression.
* But I'll use packages like Numpy, matplotlib, and sometimes Pandas to help me skip trivial obstacles.
* I'll introduce how these packages help in learning regression model:
1. Numpy:
- We will have a large amount of time using Numpy, since the calculation in numpy.array is elementwise,which is really helpful for caculating mathematics. 
   - Besides, Numpy packages can help solve linear algebra questions really fast.
   - Following are some useful codes for calculating linear algebra by using Numpy:
```
np.linalg.inv()
np.diag()
np.outer()
np.inner()
```

2. **Pandas**: 
   - Pandas can help importing data and do some summary statistics

3. **matplotlib.pyplot**: 
   - Helps for data visualization
