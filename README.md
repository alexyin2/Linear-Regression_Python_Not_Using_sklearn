## Linear Regression Python not using sklearn
* In this repository, I'll try my best to avoid using sklearn in Python since my goal is to understand how the mathmatics work in linear regression.
* But I'll use packages like Numpy, matplotlib, and sometimes pandas to help me skip several obstacles.
* I'll introduce how these packages help in learning regression model:
1. Numpy: We will have a large amount of time using Numpy, since the calculation in numpy.array is elementwise. Besides, Numpy packages can help solve linear algebra questions really fast.
